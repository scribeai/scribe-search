# Scribe Search

## Objectives

1. Render provided transcripts on a web page using React.
2. Make transcripts searchable.

These objectives are intentionally vague to encourage creativity.

Use any existing libraries you want, but React should be what primarily renders
content. Don't feel compelled to use any existing libraries besides React if
you prefer not to.

## Instructions

4. Clone your private repo onto your system.
5. Install NPM on your system if it's not already installed.
6. In your repo directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies.
7. In your repo directory, run `npm start` to start a development server.
