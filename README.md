# Scribe Search

## Objectives

1. Render provided transcripts on a web page using React.
2. Make transcripts searchable.

These objectives are intentionally open-ended to encourage creativity.

Use any existing libraries you want, but React should be what primarily renders
content. Don't feel compelled to use any existing libraries besides React if
you prefer not to.
